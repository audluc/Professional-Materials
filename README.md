# Bio-project

I created the index.html file to include the about me section as well as a navbar and background photo. I believe these are coded to be responsive to different screen configurations.
The contact.html file includes a contact form as well as a submit button and navbar. The submit buttom is not a functioning button.
Finally, the portfolio.html includes three interest photos. These should be coded as responsive as well.
This project is a bio about me and my interests
